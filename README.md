## Description

Upload and serve your WordPress media from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) with the WaaS Hero Hosting App Configurations plugin. In as little as two minutes, you will be benefitting from serving your media from Google Cloud's distributed servers.


### Benefits
* Store and deliver media files on Google Cloud Storage instead of your server.
* Google Cloud Storage is geo-redundant, meaning your media is delivered by the closest server - reducing latency and improving page speed.
* Scale your WordPress website across multiple servers without the need of synchronizing media files.
* Native integration between Google Cloud Storage and WordPress.
* $300 free trial from Google Cloud. Nice!

### Modes
* Backup - Upload media files to Google Storage and serve local file urls.
* CDN - Copy media files to Google Storage and serve them directly from there.
* Stateless - Store and serve media files with Google Cloud Storage only. Media files are not stored locally.

### Features
* Setup assistant makes getting started fast and easy.
* No need to manually create service accounts or buckets - handled automatically.
* Settings panel provides you with further GCS configuration and file url customization.
* Mask the default GCS URL with your own custom domain.
* Automatically replace hardcoded media URLs with GCS equivalents in post editor and meta.
* Batch image thumbnail regeneration.
* Synchronization tools for uploading existing files and images.
* All settings supported with wp-config constants and network setting overrides.
* Multiple modes: Backup, CDN, Stateless.
* All files served in HTTPS mode.
* Multisite compatible.
